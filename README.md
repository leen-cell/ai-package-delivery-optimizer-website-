##  Overview

This project solves the package-to-vehicle assignment and route optimization problem using **two AI algorithms**:  
- Genetic Algorithm  
- Simulated Annealing  

We built it as a **web application using Flask** to provide an interactive user interface for uploading data and viewing optimized results in the browser.

A detailed explanation of the project is available in the attached **PDF report**.

##  How to Run the Project

To run the Flask website:

### 1. Folder Structure

 project folder should look like this:

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py                   # Flask server file
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [ .html files]
â””â”€â”€ static/
    â””â”€â”€ uploads/             # Folder to store uploaded files
```

### 2. Setup and Run

1. Make sure you have Python and Flask installed:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## ðŸ“„ Notes

- Place your `.html` files inside the `templates/` folder.
- Create a folder named `uploads` inside `static/` for file handling.
- The server file (`app.py`) must be placed **at the root of the project**, not inside any folder.
